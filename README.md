#Spartan CSS _WIP_

_A mean and lean responsive boilerplate CSS solution to quickly style your webpages._

##Core

I like [Skeleton CSS](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton), but I do not like the font, spacing, and other various styling that comes with Skeleton.

So, Spartan CSS is my __WIP__ solution to integrate styling ideas from Bootstrap and Skeleton into a single, small stylesheet that can be used to prototype out small web projects. I also plan to use some Flexbox styling and other new CSS3 styles.

##Features

- small file size
- responsive support
- grid system
- modern
- ready for you to hack onto it some more
