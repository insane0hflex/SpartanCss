#Spartan CSS

_A mean and lean responsive CSS solution to quickly style your webpages._

##Core

I like (Skeleton CSS)[https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton], but do not like the font and other spacing styles.

Spartan CSS is my __WIP__ solution to integrate Bootstrap, Skeleton, and Flexbox CSS ideas into a single, small stylesheet that can be used to prototype out small web projects.

##Features

- small file size
- responsive support
- grid system
